  <h1>Test Page Two</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    A slightly more complicated web page for testing the CS484
    Web Server Programming Project.  This page requires two
    requests from the server.  The page includes such interesting HTML
    elements as:
    <ul>
      <li> Embedded and inline styles </li>
      <li> <b>Bold</b> and <em>italic</em> text</li>
      <li> Unordered list </li>
      <li> Colored text </li>
      <li> Colored background </li>
      <li> A HMMWV ready to drop! (note: HMMWV image is in a subdirectory!)</li>
    </ul>
    Even with a single thread and unqueued
    socket connection requests, this page should serve up fine.  It
    wouldn't hurt to either thread the server or, at at the very least, allow a
    few queued connections on your server to be sure this page comes
    up properly.
  </p>
  <hr>
  Your server should also serve up a video just fine, like this demonstration of sling load operations.
  <p>
    <video controls>
      <source src="/images/test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
  </p>
  <hr>
  Even JavaScript should work.
  <button type="button"
    onclick="document.getElementById('date_time').innerHTML = Date()">
    Click to get your computer's time.
  </button>
  <p id="date_time"></p>
  <hr>
  Finally, to test your redirect, click for some <a href="hmmwv.html">tactical networking</a>.
